This is a short overview of group support in [`Manifolds.jl`](https://juliamanifolds.github.io/Manifolds.jl/) and how to get started working with them.

Groups currently available in `Manifolds.jl` are listed in ``[group section](@ref GroupManifoldSection)``{=commonmark}.

You can read more about the theory of Lie groups for example in [Chirikjian:2012](@cite).
An example application of Lie groups in robotics is described in [SolaDerayAtchuthan:2021](@cite).

First, let's load libraries we will use

```{julia}
using Manifolds, RecursiveArrayTools
```


## Relationship between groups, metrics and connections


Mention invariance and the difference between `exp` and `exp_lie`.
